Task 1: Answers
a) findings:
    I noted the the similarity between cat and monkey is much high than other comparisons I add. Maybe space
    used the fact that these are animals
    Interesting note though, I was expecting the similarity of cow to elephant to be a bit higher since they are both 
    animals and mammals.
    also tiger and cat similarity is about 0.567, I thought i could be higher since they are both animals and belong to the 
    same family.

b) When using en_core_web_sm instead of en_core_web_md, the similarity indexes seem to go a bit down, only for 100% similar
   sentences are the similarity indexes higher. This confirms that the en_core_web_sm is s smaller model and less accurate that 
   en_core_web_md
